 Doctr Changelog
=================

1.3 (????-??-??)
================

Major Changes
-------------

- Remove the ``--tmp-dir`` flag from the command line (doctr now always
  deploys using a log file). (#92)
- Python API: Change ``commit_docs`` to actually commit the docs (previously,
  it was done in ``push_docs``). (#92)
- Python API: Don't sync files or get the build dir in ``commit_docs``. This
  is done separately in ``__main__.py``. The Python API for ``commit_docs`` is
  now ``commit_docs(*, added, removed)``. ``sync_from_log`` automatically
  includes the log file in the list of added files. (#92)

Minor Changes
-------------

- Correctly commit the log file. (#92)
- Fix sync_from_log to create dst if it doesn't exist, and add tests for this. (#92)
- Don't assume that doctr is being run from master when creating gh-pages. (#93)
- Return to the previous branch after deploying. (#93)
- Remove extra space before options in configure help text. (#90)

Major Changes
-------------
- Allow ``--gh-pages-docs .`` (deploying to the root directory of the
  ``gh-pages`` branch). (#73)
